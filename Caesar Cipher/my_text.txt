Cryptanalysis is the study of ciphertext,
ciphers and cryptosystems with the aim of understanding how they work and finding and improving techniques for defeating or weakening them.
For example, cryptanalysts seek to decrypt ciphertexts without knowledge of the plaintext source, encryption key or the algorithm used to encrypt it;
cryptanalysts also target secure hashing, digital signatures and other cryptographic algorithms.
While the objective of cryptanalysis is to find weaknesses in or otherwise defeat cryptographic algorithms,
cryptanalysts' research results are used by cryptographers to improve and strengthen or replace flawed algorithms.
Both cryptanalysis, which focuses on deciphering encrypted data, and cryptography,
which focuses on creating and improving encryption ciphers and other algorithms, are aspects of cryptology,
the mathematical study of codes, ciphers and related algorithms.
